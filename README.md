	A1023

	This repo is intended for the development of CWM recovery and CM for:

	AZPEN A1023
	10.1" Android Tablet
	Dual Core 1.5 Ghz Processor
	Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) OS

	This is my first port of CWM and CM to a new device; keep that in mind.
	If anything seems incorrect, out of place, missing, unnecessary--if 
	there's anything you'd like to contribute, hit me up.

	Unless stated otherwise, this repository should be considered 
	incomplete (unusuable in its current state).

	So far, most of this repository is based on or taken from the sunxi A23
	SDK.
